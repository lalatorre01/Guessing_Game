This Android app plays a guessing game.

The app randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. 

Then it asks the user to guess the number. 

If the guess is incorrect the app tells the user whether the number is greater or less than the guess. 

The user is given up to eight chances to guess. 

The game is over when the user guesses correctly or when he exceeds the eight chances. 

At the end the user is asked whether he wants to play the
game again using a dialog box. 

The dialog box has yes/no/cancel options.
